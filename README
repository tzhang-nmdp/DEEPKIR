Deep learning approach for KIR imputation like DEEPHLA
To do list:
1. Deep learning framework build
2. Model settings for KIR genomics
3. 1000genome reference data build 
(WGS KIR pipeline https://github.com/tzhang-nmdp/PING; https://github.com/tzhang-nmdp/KIR-imputation/tree/main)
4. other reference / benchmark data (HRPC) for testing

The 2nd phase of DEEPKIR aim to solve graph-based genomic mapping
